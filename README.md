# Churn-Prediction-For-Banking-Customers

Objective:
The goal of this project is to identify patterns leading to potential churn among banking customers and develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the likelihood of customer attrition.

Dataset Information:
RowNumber: Index for each record in the dataset.
CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer.
Surname: Last name of the customer.
CreditScore: Numerical measure of the customer's creditworthiness.
Geography: Country or region where the customer is located (e.g., France, Spain, Germany).
Gender: Gender of the customer (e.g., Male or Female).
Age: Age of the customer.
Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
Balance: Account balance of the customer.
NumOfProducts: Number of bank products the customer is using (e.g., savings accounts, loans, etc.).
HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 for yes, 0 for no).
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member (1 for yes, 0 for no).
EstimatedSalary: Estimated annual salary of the customer.
Exited: Indicates whether the customer has churned or not (1 for churned, 0 for not churned).

Approach:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify correlations.
Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and prepare data for modeling.
Development of predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks) to forecast customer churn.
Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC).
Deployment of the best-performing model for practical application.

Tools and Libraries:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and modeling
Visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for graphical representation
Machine Learning algorithms for predictive modeling
